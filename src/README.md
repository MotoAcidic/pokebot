# Pokébot / src

The `src` directory contains the source code and node modules for Pokébot. This is where the `node_modules` directory should go when the repository is cloned onto a local machine. Eventually the `src` directory will contain subdirectories that contain other source code files after `index.js` is split up and classes are created.
